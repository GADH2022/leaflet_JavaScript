Level-1: Basic Visualization
Get the Data Set
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes
The "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" data set was selected from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page
The data was given in JSON format which was used to pull in the data for the visualization
Import and Visualize the Data
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color
Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake were included when a marker is clicked
A legend was created to provide context for the map data
